```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a minimal example of using the code in `hawkes` package. The package is very preliminary stages of development. The main functions are illustrated here. The \hawkes\man for a full list  

First install and load the package. 

```{r cars}
devtools::install_github("peterhalpin/hawkes")
library("hawkes")
```
It comes with an example dataset, `email` of email exchanges between an employer and employee (Halpin & DeBoeck, 2013). 

```

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
