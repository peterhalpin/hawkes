```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a minimal example of using the code in `hawkes` package. The package is very preliminary stages of development. The main functions are illustrated here. 

First load the package

```{r cars}
devtools::install_github("peterhalpin/hawkes")
library("hawkes")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
